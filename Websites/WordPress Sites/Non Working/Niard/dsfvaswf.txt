what does money mean to you. 
You won't believe what it means to me
it means the family dont have to stick it with all those broken dreams
it means i  can finnaly kick it in the social scene
it means i can stop worrying and take a sec to breath
cause alot of people can't see someone feel like he's suffering
feel so numb from pain that he feels nothing man 
just sit there, eyes dry, pointed at the horizon 
hes crying inside, cause every one he loves is dying 
he doesn't believe in god, or thinks he just not trying 
he mad at the public, wants politicians to stop lying
but understands with 2 partys some parties are left silient
poverty is the root of all crime if you look at the science
but they already know that and that what scares the shit out of me
i was born in america, where were rich and free
but were lock in a bubble as big as our income
