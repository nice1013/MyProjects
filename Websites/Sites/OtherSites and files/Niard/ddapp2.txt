The Numbers For Both Sides 

Shops waste money employing drivers that have to sit
and wait for a delivery which may, or may-not happen. 
A shop can waste hundreds of dollars each year on do-nothing drivers. 
And Drivers don't benifit eiter during slow times in the day, since 
they make most of their money from tips.

The Shop Numbers 

**Note** 
Although the minimal wage is 7.25 i have worked, 
and know of places that pay only $5 an hour. And in even more 
extreme cases $3 an hour. 
With that in mind we use $5 dollars as our base amount to calculate 
pay-per Miles

Driver#4 = 130.00
Shop pays all drivers = $140.00 just for friday.



--------
Why were great
-------
The only time drivers and shops are making money together is 
when its busy. So what we do, manage drivers for multiple shops, 
and concentrate the work so that all parties get more for their money. 

standard pay for drivers for 8 hours($40.00) 
	--divided by-- 
Highest avg miles per 8 hours (110)

= $.36363636... per mile. (at least)



So if we convert all the numbers and adjust the number for 3 shops this is what we get 


Shop#1 + shop#2 + shop#3 

450 deliveries a day


	Shift1: All Morning 8 hours (54 deliveries)
	Shift2: All Afternoon 8 hours (234 deliveries) 

With our decentralized delivery system, We can increase the rate in which 
we can deliver goods By allowing drivers to come to your place and pick up 
the delivery, take it to the customers house,and instead of returning to your place,
returning to the closest first delivery we can save alot of time. 

So WE KNOW, Again
a driver can pull 30 deliveries in an 8 hour period with decent lee-way. However due to demand, it hardly reaches that. 

Reason why: 
Driver#1 always pulls low, as the morning to afternoon isn't as busy. 

Driver#2 and #3 have a great amount per hour, but on somedays, there is no demand and it seems they sit at 
the place all day. 

Driver#4 is there during the rush, and has the night all to himself, so he gets a few more than anyone else. However, 
because demand is low, his throughput isn't as good as the people who are just there for the rush. 






So there is some demand, but drivers dont always get a good deal, and shops dont get as good of bang for their
buck. So the Solution. 

If drivers handle 30 a shift, here how we can save some money.

Morning Shift Consist of 54 Deliveries. If a driver can handle 30Dph clearly 2 people 
will be able to handle this shift.

and if Afternoon consist of 234 clearly 8 people can handle this. 




so lets see the new numbers for all parties involved. 


SHOPS---------------

Shop#1 paid  $70.90 
[390 miles / 2 * $.363636 = Estimated Shop Mileage Payment * $.363636 = 195 * $.363636 = $70.90]

All Shops combined paid $212.70 instead of $420.00 a total 50% savings. 





Drivers----------------


1st shift pulls $110.10 per shift. 
[54dels / 2drives = 27 + 2 * 27 + 80 * .36363636 = 27 + 54 + 29.10 = $110.10 per shift]

second shift pulls $123.00 per shift.
[234del / 8drivers = 29delspershift = 29 + 2 * 29 + 100 * .36363636 = 29 + 58 + 36 = 123.00] 

As you can see Driver make the same amount of money and shops save a little. 
But thats without our system in play. 









GOING SUPER SAYIAN 

Algorythms will boost the production of drivers by eliminating the need to return to the orignal delivery shop. 

Problems CASH, CREDIT CARDs, how will we deal with this. 

For Cash, Our Drivers will pay for the order before taking the delivery. 

For Credit Cards that need validation, A Delivery Id number will be written on reciept. No updates Can be made 
or they have notify shop immediately. The CCVR is kept with driver until reaching a new shop, where it is deposited 
into a receipt bank. A Head Driver will circulate stores, and make sure all shops get their reciepts. 

Shop Responsibilities: To gather all items for delivery and have ready for driver.
			

Driver Responsibilities: To make sure soda is with delivery if nessary. To make sure dels make it to customer. 
			ensure CCVR are returned to a shop where CCVR's are ACCEPTED. 
			


What Happens if... 

The Driver forgot the soda... 
	The Driver Responsible will return and finished the delivery. 

An item wasn't correct..... 
	Any food item that is not correct or not with the delivery is the shop's responsibility.
	The Shop will have to cast a redelivery at cost, and no food or items shall be returned to the shop. 

The Driver was robbed of everything... 
	The Driver was robbed of food and money. This is serious, call the cops, and report the incadent. 
	Since Both Parties were affected, no one is refunded any money or damages. 

The Driver was robbed of delivery..... 
	We claimed responsibilities for 40% of the value of items are refunded to the shop provided by +Drivers.
