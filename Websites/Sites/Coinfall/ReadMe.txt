This was a silly idea to make the txt records of a website attached 
to a dogecoin address. That way you could send coins to people 
just by using their address. It needed to use a modified version 
of multidoge which i did. The multidoge would call for the 
address based on the username@domain. fun fun fun. learn 
about packages for java this way.
