This was fun. Its a space theme website using javascript 
to move the images in the background. I also created the timeline 
and added all the events on it. You can see the current version on 
dogecointimeline.com . It is currently maintained by another user
that manages the server. I forget his name, but he's a sweet dude. 
It took a bunch of photoshop too. The glass effect is actually 
my favorite part. Believe it or not, it really brought it all together 
for me.
