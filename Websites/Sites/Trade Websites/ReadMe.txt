This was a fun one. This is the php arbrator i made 
for cryptsy.com. It took a couple months. Totally wasted. 
wasn't quick enough to react. for obvious reasons now. 
its fucking php and javascript. lol . 


autotrading/ 
	is the ugly guts of the beast. oh yeah. no fucking comments. 
	what type of asshole writes 1000s of lines of code and 
	doesn't put comments. ME! in 2012. fucking asshole.

Trade/
	is a pretty layer on top of the autotrading. 
	all autotrading files are inside of trade.
