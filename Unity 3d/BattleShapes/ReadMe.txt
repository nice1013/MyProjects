BattleShapes is a UNFINISHED top-down game similar to mushroom wars
or tenticle battles or something like that. 
I made it cause i loved this type of game, but all the 
games on the market are a bunch of gold sucking gypsies. 
It was nice to make, but i never finished it as i had an 
idea to make a bitcoin trading app that could make money
in a more, black and white, is it working kind of way. 
But still, i managed to create an ugly p2p game. 
I think i was even up to making levels. I forget now. W.e.
