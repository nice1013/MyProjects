Coinfall is a simple game i made to learn the in and outs of unity. 
Its a simple pop the coins as they fall game. 
It used to have leaderboards from google, but apparently through 
the updates that has become broken. I don't really care. It's 
not like this game has ever made any money. Also this 
game is before unity updated for google play services. 
So i had to do a bunch of jar managing here to get the thing
to work properly.
