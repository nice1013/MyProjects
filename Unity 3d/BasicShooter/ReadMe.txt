I made this real quick from 12pmto 5pm on Dec 13th just so i can get reaqanted 
with Unity3d. I created a basic level. Added Rigid bodies, collides. The guy runs around and collects capsuls. At 3 capsules it will load the next level. One of the levels allows the guy to shoot. There are no builds for this as it was all for practice.
