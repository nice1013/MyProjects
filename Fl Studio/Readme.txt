I created something like 200 beats. 1000+ hours wasted. 
With tempos usually 80 to 120 bpm. 
I created sounds, splice audios, reverbed played with all the bells for years. 
I stopped this, because i got bored and sucked at it. I also needed a better microphone and speakers so that i could correctly master the audio. I could never get it on my trashed picked speakers.
