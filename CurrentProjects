So my current projects are NOT on here. There may be parts that are used within those projects here, but they are only part of the project. Seeing how i used this github mostly for work references. I figure i list the current things im working on. 



Bitcoin Crypto-Curreny Trader:  :
	It is started using Bash. Runs using Python3 for fetching the data and uses Python2.7 for analyzing and commiting trades when it feels like it.
This is finished, and active.

Dealorship Management Program. :
	This is a simple rational database application. Uses Sqlite and Python while on PC (Linux or Window). Android as external device. 
This is in the begining stages of development. 

Waver -- Android App. :
	This is a weird little app im making. Thats all i can really say about it. I'm in a sort of r&d phase. How to implement the idea has been harder than expected. Though, i believe it's only a matter of time before i figure out the way to do it, and it'll be done. So really like were in that stage whether I find out whether it's even possible... for me atleast.
