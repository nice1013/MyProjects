Oh kay.... 
So what this puppy does, it look at the screen. (you'll need dual monitor)
It has a record mode, which would take pics every .1 seconds then look 
at what button was beeing pressed at that time. I figured with thousands of 
pictures the thing could predict with sklearns neural network
which way the ball was going. I believe it did work. 
in that matter. however when it came to playing, lol. it was awful. 
I believe what holds me back with neural networks is well, i don't know 
enough about how the activation functions work. If I can get a grip on the 
model in my head, im pretty sure you can extrapolate it to pretty much every 
facet of life. That would take a lifetime of work.
