I was working on this trading platform in python and i notice, 
that well, things didn't run cocurrently or asynchounous. So, any way, it didn't run at the same time. I read up and found out about 
that GIL in python, and simply was testing that. I think i even ended 
up seeing if can break the computer. (SUCESS!) So im pretty sure you shouldn't run this.
